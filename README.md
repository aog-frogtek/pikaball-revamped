# Pikachu Volley - Revamped Edition
**English** | [Español (Spanish)](./README_ES.md)

---

A modern C++ reimplementation of the classic Pikachu Volleyball game using SDL3.

This is the spiritual successor of the "Pikachu Volley - Murcia LAN Party special edition".


## About

The original game was created by "SACHI SOFT / SAWAYAKAN Programmers" and "Satoshi Takenouchi" in 1997.
A few years ago, Kyutae Lee  ([gorisanson](https://github.com/gorisanson)) did some amazing work reverse-engineering the game and porting the original code to Javascript: [Pikachu Volleyball game](https://github.com/gorisanson/pikachu-volleyball).
You can even [play it online](https://gorisanson.github.io/pikachu-volleyball/en/)!

This project is a C++ adaptation of the original game using SDL3, heavily inspired by the Javascript version.


This "Revamped" version features:
- **Cross-platform support** using SDL3. Built and tested on Windows and Linux.
- **Two build options**: a portable build with embedded assets (easy to move around, just like the original game) and the default build with assets in a directory (easier to mod and experiment with the game files).
- **Special sprites** modified by the Murcia LAN Party team in 2009.

## Download
You can download the executable for Windows and Linux from the [Releases](https://github.com/butakus/pikaball-revamped/releases) page.

### Windows:
Download the `pikaball_revamped.exe` file and run it!

### Linux:
There is a Flatpak file available for Linux. After downloading it, you can install it with this command:

```flatpak --user install pikaball_revamped.flatpak```

The flatpak will create a `.desktop` entry for you.
You can launch the game by clicking on the icon, or by running this in the terminal:

```flatpak run io.github.butakus.pikaball```

*Note: You must have flatpak installed with the Flathub repository enabled [[Guide](https://flathub.org/en/setup)].*
